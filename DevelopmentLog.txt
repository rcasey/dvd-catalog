28-dec-2014 Added pagination gem; but this broke the global index, which
    is necessary to compute the page & slot position.
    
    Note this requirement in a page/slot index number: a new category
    
    So the challenge now is to find out how to:
    - perhaps compute a page/slot per dvd?
    - failing the above, to preserve a global index?

    Requirement: the beginning of every Category must begin
    on a new page.
    Requirement: Titles are sorted alphabetically within Category, and
    Categories are sorted alphabetically.
    Every Title will have these 2 attributes: page & slot, called
    a page/slot index, abbreviated PSI, written as p/s.
    These indicate which page it located, and which slot on that
    page.
    There are 4 slots per page side, but the pages are two sided,
    so s = [1...8])
        
    Definition of page/slot index, psi, where
    T = total discs, [t = 0,T]
    C = number of discs in category (restarts at 1 for each Category)
    P = page number
    cat = Category assigned to Title
    SLOTS_PER_PAGE = 8
    
    To create the PSI:
    cur_c = ""
    while (Titles)
        if (cur_c <> Category)
            s = 1
            cur_c = Category
        else            
            s = s + 1
            t = t + 1
        if mod(t,SLOTS_PER_PAGE) = 0, then
            p = p + 1
            s = 1
        Assign p,s to Title
    end
